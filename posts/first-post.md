I've been toying around the idea of a redesigned site for quite a while now.
Retaining some aspects of the old site but work it from ground up, rewriting
every single line of code.

It's always a bit hard to let old things go, especially if you spent a good
weekend learning, tweaking, and getting angry (like a true web developer)
over it. Every time I feel the need to rewrite I learn
and work a little faster than the last time. Experience gained from previous
pains and mistakes. Hey, isn't that how life works in general?

V.3 (or 4?) of the site takes a considerably sharp turn from my previous
architectures. I've travelled a long hard road of wordpress, nodejs and django
and finally settled on Flask/postgresql.

I feel the technology is an extension of the user. I've
developed a love and hate relationship with Python. While wordpress offers
a comprehensive tools and extensions library, I felt it's too bulky and
didn't suite my needs. Nodejs on the other hand, was light weight and super
simple to setup, yet the javascript doctrine was just too foreign. Flask is one
of those things that drives you crazy on the little details but you learn to
love on the long run, sort of like a cat. And we all know cat makes *everything*
better.

The hardest part, as always, is coming up with a design that fits me. I'm the
sort of person that would bookmark a website simply because it looked nice.
I would browse around and think: *Woah! This header would look great on my
site!*. For this version, I've taken my inspiration from two sources, the
beautifully designed [MinimallyMinimal](http://www.minimallyminimal.com/) and
a wordpress theme called [Origami](http://demo.siteorigin.com/origami/).

I've always had a thing for the minimal, clean, and organized look. The
interfaces of a site should be a funnel to the actual content. Readers shouldn't
waste time trying to figure out where the contents are, where their eyes should
be, which button to press.

Minimal, responsive design is also the best way to tackle a site's realty limits
on hand-held devices such as phones and tablets. I find myself spending more and
more time in front of my phone or tablet than my computer screen, having
a seamless transition is an important design issue.

Make it work first, then make it better.
