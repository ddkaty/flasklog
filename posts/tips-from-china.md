Here are some useful and interesting things I've noticed while I'm in China:

1. Don't look both ways while you're crossing the road, because you'll never
   get to the other side if you do. Just walk and hope the driver sees you.

2. It's not rude to chew with your mouth open, sometimes it's rude not too.

3. Don't be offended when someone drops the N\* word repeatedly, they're most
   like just pointing something out to you in Chinese.

4. Use your seniority in age wisely, things such as "you pay, I'm older than you." 
   is a completely legitimate excuse to get out of paying for a meal. Just note 
   that this works both ways, don't complain when you're stuck with the bill =)

5. Don't get turned off by the cleanliness of some restaurants. Sometimes they
   offer the best tasting and legitimate foods.

6. Listed prices are always negotiable, you just need to be persistent and
   pretend you don't speak any Chinese/English, but just enough to convey how much
   you're willing to pay. Works like a charm.

7. Learn to spot StarBucks, for 5$ you have a clean, upper classy place to leech
   as much internet as you want. Coffee isn't any cheaper, but it's better than
   those internet cafes'

8. Those manual/electric peddlers (not sure what they're called, they're
   everywhere in major cities) are literally the fastest and cheapest way to get 
   around a big city. It's much cheaper than Taxis and you get to sight see along
   the way. You just need to get over the fact that someone's peddling your fat
   ass around the town, just give them a hug/big tip to help you sleep better at
   night. 

9. Tipping is not required at most places (except places specifically catered to
   westerners), so don't feel bad to not give a tip, if you insist on commending 
   your man/woman in waiting, just pull up their manager or tell them straight
   up. It might be cheesy but a good complement goes a long way.

10. Last but not least, if you can only bring one thing to China, bring some
    toilet paper. Don't be cheap, go out and find the most expensive, softest
    tripple padded cashmere stuffed tree killing kind, you'll thank yourself
    later. The crap they use in China is a crime against humanity, saying it's
    like sandpaper is an understatement.
