Happy New Year!

As 2011 draws to a close, it's time to reflect on the year passed. 2011 has
been fruitful to say the least; two wonderful coop terms at at an amazing
[start-up](chango.com) and a not so wonderful summer school term later, the year
draws to a close with a peaceful week off.

Probably spending way too much time on Reddit over the year, but it's all time
well wasted. For the times that are better spent, it's been a fairly productive
year with work, school and personal projects. 2011 was the year that I wanted to
better explore myself and try to find something that I find interesting and can
find time to work on. In the process, I hoped that it would show me what area
I should work towards and improve on. Looking back, it certainly has.

Time passed way too fast for 2011, I suppose that's the case when you're always
on the go and days fall into a routine. Work, school, work has it's rhythms, and
for better or for worse it's not a bad way to go.

2011 has been a great year, and 2012 will be just as magnificent. Happy New Year! Gon
Xi Fa Cai!
