Beside [Learn Code the Hard Way](http://learncodethehardway.org/) series (a must

both free and for a fee, that are available on the internet for anyone to pick
up and get started with. The Learn series is a common starting point that
I found that helped me with the fundamentals of programming languages and their
concepts such as Python, Ruby and SQL. Most recently I've been reading up on
Regex since it's such a powerful took that I feel like I should have an idea
about.

Here are a good list:
