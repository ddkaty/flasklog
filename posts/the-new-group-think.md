> #Collaboration is in. But it may not be conducive to creativity.

One thing being an engineer has taught me is that you're almost never the
smartest person in the room. And if you are, you're most definitely in the wrong
room.

In the four years of undergrad in engineering it also taught me one thing: learn
how to be an anti-social, be an introvert.

I find working in isolation gives me a sense of security and confidence in a way
that you wouldn't normally have when exposed in public. It allows me to think
and act in my own way without limited by social norms.

Who wouldn't want to lurk around in their underwear and churn out code all day.

But socially, we value the outspoken, the charismatic, the Steve J. and forget
about the introvert, the intrapersonal, the Steve W.

Modern society encourages more "Group Think" and discourages individualism.
Managers value "people skills" more than ability to perform well.

Engineers are suppose to be practical, we aren't Steve Jobs, that's why you
don't see many of us giving TED talks or big conference keynotes. Because it
makes us uncomfortable, insecure.

We work well in teams, if we have to. We are creative, in the right conditions.
But not in weekly iteration meetings. We don't like it, and we think it's
a waste of time.

Funny thing about being an engineering student it that, by the time you learn
how to be a good introvert, you're then forced into a group and expected to come
up with creative ideas for a Fourth year design project.

Really?

There's a few thing I see wrong with this.

1. Group before idea: Why not the other way. Give us time to think up a good
   idea, and let us sell our idea to interested classmates. Brain storming in
   groups never work. Too many ideas on the table with too many different
   interests.
2. Groups: I don't mind randomized grouping. In real life, you won't be friends
   with everyone on your team. Might start now.
3. Sort by 4th year class choices: Okay, pseudo-random. Sort by pre-elective
   interests would be a good indicator of interest.

Make these changes, and give us freedom to be anti-social. Because real
creativity comes from focusing on what's at hand, not what's going on at your
neighbours party. Besides, Newton was an introvert, and heck, he sure was smart.
