I started this blog over the xmas holidays as a side project. Getting to this
point took me two weeks of half assed research and even more half assed drunk
programming.

For the past two years I've used wordpress, I've messed around with druple and
dated it's ugly cousin joomla for a while too. Every time I lie to myself, and
say that I will sit down and learn some php, so I can have a pinch of an idea 
what the hell I'm doing with wordpress customization (I mean wth is 
"The Loop"?), I end up giving up in frustration or get distracted by shinier
things.

Don't get me wrong, I'm sure wordpress in the right hands can be a powerful
tool of destruction (case in point: pine cone + rubber bands + MacGyver).

It's like a bad break up, in the end of it all I'm the one
apologizing: No honey, it's not you, it's me.

With that all behind me, I am ready to move on to younger and sexier things 
(shallow? you jest).

NodeJS,
--------

seemed like the obvious choice. It's hip, it's cool and a lot of buzz
surrounding it this year. I know enough javascript to skip the 'hello world'
tutorials and move on the the actual useful things. A full twenty minutes of
research later, I've concluded a few things:

- [Express](expressjs.com) is the de facto web framework to use.
- [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) is cool.
- [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) is the hip (read buzzword b.s.) way to go.
- [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) 'cus I said so.

So with all the technologies figured out, I'm ready to do some code.

Setting shit up,
---------

[This.](http://apptob.org/) Go to it, 'nuff said.

Okay, 'Hello World' app?
---------

I searched around the internet for a good baby step beginner tutorial,
[NetTuts+](http://net.tutsplus.com/sessions/node-js-step-by-step/)
has some amazing get-you-started tutorials that guides you from setting up
your environment to making a very basic blogging application. I didn't end up
following it, kind of just hastily browsed through it's github repo. and went to
[this](http://www.nodebeginner.org/) instead. I highly recommend following this
book, it's very short, took me all of 30 minutes to finish it and started
messing around on my own. But it did it's job, got me started and ended with
me wanting more.

Um, where can I host my Node for free?
---------

[CloudNode](http://cloudno.de/). I found it on this
[info](http://www.nodecloud.org/) site. CloudNode is in private beta right now,
it's a free NodeJS hosting platform using specialized Virtual Node Machines (no
idea what that shit means). Basically, give them your email, wait a couple days,
and bam you have a place to host your app. 

But if you have your own VPS, I don't think I need to tell you how to setup and
deploy NodeJS.

Is there like, a PEP8 for NodeJS?
---------

Yes. Kinda. If you're an amazing (read OCD) programmer like me, read [Felix's
Node.js Guide](http://nodeguide.com/), specifically the Style section.

Conclusion
---------

Setting up is the easy part. Well the coding part isn't that bad either. I have
to say javascript is a lot nicer to wrap my brain around than PHP (no love),
it's a good learning experience, and I don't regret starting it.

Thanks for reading!
